%% How can I use \subsubsubsection in Latex, so that I can refer to it and also it appears in the table of contents?
% Here is a style file that you will need to use. It has entries to create subsubsubsection and subsubsubsubsection. If you need more then you should add whatever you need by taking the previous level of sub and adding a "sub" everywhere and change the level indicator {5} to {6}.
% I call this file subsections.sty:

% Here is an example file that worked with this style file:

% \documentstyle[subsections]{article}
% \setcounter{secnumdepth}{5}
% \setcounter{tocdepth}{5}
% \begin{document}
