\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I wish to express gratitude to my supervisors Manuel and Gabi for their guidance in the times of confusion and exploration of unknown territories.

I am glad to have been part of PLS team who strives to do great work at the intersection of engineering and science. I especially thank Ben Lippmeier for numerous impromptu lessons that were invaluable at the start of my degree.

I would also like to thank Prof. Ricardo Pe√±a for his guidance during my stay at Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

I am grateful to my family and friends who offered their support throughout my degree.

I am indebted to the literary works of Stephen Covey and Brian Tracey among others, who motivated me to develop myself time and again.

Finally, this work would not have been possible without Nataly, her heroic patience, encouragement and love.
